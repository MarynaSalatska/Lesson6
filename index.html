      Many businesses have pursued a hybrid model, where employees work both from home and in the office. Workers
      knowing
      what's expected of them at work can correlate with <br>
      productivity gains of 5% to 10%, and 10% to 20% fewer on-the-job accidents. A study in Germany found that 71% of
      workers strongly agree that their manager is fully aware <br>
      of their projects and tasks, and 65% strongly agree that they communicate with their manager daily. Employer
      communication and expectations are an important factor in the culture <br>
      of a workplace.

        One analysis found that 75% of companies conducted remote interviews and onboarding sessions during the
        pandemic,
        61% of companies advertised fully remote jobs during the pandemic, and 60% <br> of companies expanded their
        candidate search
        geographically during the pandemic. Hiring and recruiting statistics reveal some interesting things about the
        modern workplace. The job search, the <br>
        interview process, and the office have all changed a great deal in recent years. The numbers clearly show that
        more
        and more of professional life has moved online, and as technology improves, this trend <br> is likely to
        continue. Companies
        and employees alike are having to adjust to this new paradigm. As a worker and as a job-seeker, it is integral
        for you
        to stay engaged and productive in the face of the <br> changing workplace.

      <img src="img/nature.jpg" alt="nature">
      <p>
        Easily one of the most beautiful spots in Canada, Banff National Park overwhelms with views of the Canadian Rockies and <br>
        a regular cast of animals. The park is also known for its abundance of beautiful lakes, including Lake Louise, Moraine <br>
        Lake, and glacial Lake Minnewanka—each more pristine than the last.
      </p>
      <h2>Serengeti National Park, Tanzania</h2>
      <img class="tanzania" src="img/Tanzania.jpg" alt="Tanzania">
      <p>
        Tanzania’s portion of the Serengeti is the ideal location for an African adventure. Visit between January and March to <br>
        witness the wonder that is the Great Migration, an iconic phenomenon that sees 1.5 million wildebeest sweep through East <br>
        Africa on an annual, 1,200-mile cycle.

        Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia
        Southwest Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni is the largest salt flat in the world, and is about as surreal as landscapes come. <br>
        When dry, the flat is a sheet of blindingly white salt tiles. During the wet season, the shallow lake mirrors the sky, <br>
        creating a dreamy illusion of infinity.
